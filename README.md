## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Node.js and a package manager like npm installed.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/social-media-automator.git
    cd social-media-automator
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    # If using Vite
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

    # If using Create React App
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    *The application code expects `process.env.API_KEY`. Build tools like Vite and Create React App expose environment variables with specific prefixes (`VITE_` or `REACT_APP_`) to the frontend code.*

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on your local machine, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

2.  Fill in the **Main Topic** for your content.
3.  Select the desired **Target Audience** and **Tone** from the dropdown menus.
4.  Under **Select Platforms & Formats**, enable the social media platforms you want to generate content for using the toggle switches.
5.  For each enabled platform, choose a specific content format from its dropdown list.
6.  Click the **"Generate Posts"** button.
7.  The AI-generated content will appear on the right-hand side, organized into cards for each platform.
